				<h3>One</h3>
				<p>I best not try to predict what I will make, before I make it.</p>
			</div>

				<h3>Two</h3>
				<p>I have found that <b>What I Have</b>, and what Earth gives, will beget <b>What I Make</b>.</p>

				<h3>Three</h3>
				<p>To myself, I say - "Look to what you have done; see the beauty of it."</p>

				<h3>Four</h3>
				<p>"Do not worry over the nature of what you will accomplish in the future. Do not ask if it will be good enough. Do not crave for it either!"</p>

				<h3>Five</h3>
				<p> "What you and the Unknown make now will determine what you will have later.</p>
				<p>And thus, what you will have later... is yours to shape now."</p>

				<h3>Six</h3>
				<p> I think of personal events as flowing in this manner:</p>
				<p>What I've done -> What I have now (my resource) -> What I can do with my resource -> What I will have done.</p>
				<p>"Accept the uncertainty of what you will create and <b>flow."</b></p> 
				</div>

				<h3>Seven</h3>
				<p>
				"Flow and notice how the Earth's flow, another person's flow - an <b>OverFlow</b> - will spil over and fill your subjective gaps and holes."
				<p> "The off-<i>spring</i> of this process is experienced as a deep, satisfying drink...a drink of one's life - multiplied by endless possiblilities."</p>
